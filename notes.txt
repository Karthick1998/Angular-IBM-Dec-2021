    Assumptions: 
        Our solution meets 100% of the user requirements
            No validations are required
            NO error messages are required

        The application will be prepared for deployment by another team
            They will refactor the css styles into another .css file
            They will refactor the js code into another .js file

Component (View) = Presentation + UI Behavior + Sync the model state changes
Application = Composition of components

ES6 (ECMAScript 6 / ES2015 / ESNext)
    1. let
    2. const
    3. Array destructuring
        var nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
        var [x, y] = nos

    4. Rest operator (array)
        var nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
        var [x,y, ...z]= nos

        function sum(...args){
            let result = 0;
            for (let i=0; i < args.length; i++)
                result += args[i]
            return result;
        }

    5. Spread operator (array)
        var nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
        var newNos = [...nos, 10, 20, 30]

        function sum(...args){
            let result = 0;
            for (let i=0; i < args.length; i++)
                result += args[i]
            return result;
        }
        sum(...nos)

    6. object destructuring
        var product = {
            id : 100,
            name : 'Pen',
            cost : 10
        }
        undefined
        var { id , cost } = product

        var {id : x, cost : y } = product

    7. rest operator (object)
        var product = {
            id : 100,
            name : 'Pen',
            cost : 10
        }
        undefined
        var { id, ...z } = product

    8. spread operator (object)
        var discountedProduct = { ...product, discount : 10 }


Application Setup
    1. Web Server
    2. TypeScript compiler
    3. Unit testing
    4. E2E testing
    5. Test Runner
    6. Code Coverage
    7. Build configuration

Source of State Changes
    1. User interactions -> Events
    2. Timer
    3. Ajax calls

Angular Building Blocks
    1. Component
        View
        Encapsulation of Presentation + UI Behavior + State
    2. Pipe
        Transform the data for presentation purposes
    3. Directive
        DOM manipulation
        Types of Directives
            1. Attribute Directive
                Manipulates the attributes of existing DOM Nodes
                DOES NOT change the structure of DOM tree (by adding / removing dom nodes)
                used with '[]'

            2. Structural Directive
                Changes the structure of the DOM tree (by adding / removing dom nodes)
                used with prefix '*'

    4. Service
        NON UI logic
    5. Module
        Directory of the application entities (Components, Pipes, Directives, Services & Modules)
        There has to be a minimum of 1 module in an application
        The application bootstrapping is by the module

ES6 Modules
    Alternatives (AMD - Asynchronous Module Definition, CommonJS - CommonJS Modules)

    1. Everything defined in a file is considered 'private' to that file
    2. Any entity to be accessible from other files have to be explicitly 'exported'
    3. Any public entity from another file has to be explicitly 'imported' to use
