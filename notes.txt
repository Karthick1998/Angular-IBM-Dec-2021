    1. let
    2. const
    3. Array destructuring
        var nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
        var [x, y] = nos

    4. Rest operator (array)
        var nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
        var [x,y, ...z]= nos

        function sum(...args){
            let result = 0;
            for (let i=0; i < args.length; i++)
                result += args[i]
            return result;
        }

    5. Spread operator (array)
        var nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
        var newNos = [...nos, 10, 20, 30]

        function sum(...args){
            let result = 0;
            for (let i=0; i < args.length; i++)
                result += args[i]
            return result;
        }
        sum(...nos)

    6. object destructuring
        var product = {
            id : 100,
            name : 'Pen',
            cost : 10
        }
        undefined
        var { id , cost } = product

        var {id : x, cost : y } = product

    7. rest operator (object)
        var product = {
            id : 100,
            name : 'Pen',
            cost : 10
        }
        undefined
        var { id, ...z } = product

    8. spread operator (object)
        var discountedProduct = { ...product, discount : 10 }
